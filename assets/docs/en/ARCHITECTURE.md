# HomeAgent Architecture

## Architectural Principles

HomeAgent's cognitive architecture consists of three subsystems: the event loop (eventLoop), the context window (RelevanceContext), and the stage pipeline (StageHost). Together they form the orchestration framework. Within this framework, the LLM serves as a scheduled reasoning unit; cognitive continuity is maintained by the event loop, context window, and stage pipeline.

**The event loop (eventLoop)** is a three-way select: `a.io.InputChan()` receives external user input and dispatches to `processTextInput` / `processMediaInput`; `a.selfInputCh` receives internal system tasks (memory merges, distillation callbacks) routed through `processConsolidation` under the `_consolidation_` output channel; `a.ctx.Done()` accepts shutdown signals. A concurrently running `interceptLoop` goroutine independently reads `a.io.InputInterruptChan()` — on receiving a high-priority interrupt, it cancels the in-flight LLM HTTP request (`a.cancelLLM()`), then writes the event to `a.interceptCh`. This channel is drained non-blockingly by `drainInterrupts()` before each LLM call in `process()`, injecting interrupts as `[打断消息]` formatted entries into message history. The three interrupt delivery paths carry distinct semantics: `cancelLLM` terminates the current HTTP request, `interceptCh` injects text before the next LLM turn, and `InjectInput` triggers a new processing cycle when the event loop is idle.

**The stage pipeline (StageHost)** manages two registration categories: tool definitions (ToolDef) and stage handlers (StageHandler). ToolDef includes two optional memory control fields: `NoMemory bool` — when true, the tool's output is excluded from vectorization/jieba/distillation (original text preserved); and `Cleaner func(string) string` — a filter applied before the output enters the computation layer (e.g., extracting a `content` field from JSON). Neither modifies the original output; both only affect the computation layer input. `RegisterTool` rejects duplicate names, infers the owning plugin name from the tool name prefix, and maintains a `toolPlugins` mapping. `RegisterStage` appends handlers to the corresponding stage list. On stage execution (`RunStage`), **all registered handlers execute in parallel via goroutines**, sharing a single `*StageContext` protected by `sync.RWMutex`. Individual handler panics are recovered independently without affecting other handlers. Short-circuit semantics are implemented by checking `ctx.Response != nil` — any stage handler can set this value to terminate the pipeline early. `ExecuteTool` includes built-in panic recovery with stack-trace recording. `UnregisterPluginTools` removes a plugin's tool set during hot-reload.

**The context window (RelevanceContext)** maintains a chronologically ordered event list. `Append` aggregates tool outputs through `textForVector` before computing the embedding vector: `NoMemory` skips, `Cleaner` filters (per-tool cleaners registered by plugins — e.g. the QQ plugin strips its own tool-call templates), and `CleanText` finalizes with basic whitespace normalization. A three-branch strategy selects the text source (agent events use Response, user events use Input, cold_storage uses Input+Response). `Prune` triggers when the event count exceeds `topK`: it **unconditionally protects the last 10 events from eviction** (recency bias), scores remaining candidates against the current input via CosineSimilarity, keeps `topK - 10` highest-scoring entries (floor at 0), then re-sorts chronologically. Pruned events from sources other than `agentcli` and `terminal` are archived to the Document layer via `docStore.ContextToDoc`, retaining original timestamps. Persistence uses 5-second debounced writes to a JSON file.

**Tool definitions are aggregated from five sources**: IOManager-registered plugin tools; StageHost-registered SDK tools; Indexer-provided memory index tools; conditionally added built-in tools (depending on non-nil state of memory/knowledge/docStore/social/pluginReg/providerManager modules — including memory operations, knowledge retrieval, document queries, social networking, plugin reloading, child-agent spawning, per-output-channel send tools, and LLM source switching); and media processing tools added based on `pendingMedia` state. `buildToolDefs()` re-aggregates all sources on each process cycle.

**Provider invocation follows an ordered fallback strategy**: `ProviderManager.OrderedProviders()` returns the provider list in registration order. The `process()` inner loop iterates this list attempting `Chat()` on each. HTTP 401/403 responses mark the provider as permanently unavailable; other error types also mark unavailability but with higher tolerance. If all providers fail, an error is returned to the caller. If a call is interrupted by context cancellation while the agent is still running, it is retried (only on non-consolidation paths).

**The memory system adopts a three-tier storage hierarchy (Context → Document → Graph), tiering data by access locality and persistence requirements**: the Context layer is a fast-volatile working window using StaticEmbedder (pretrained word embeddings with TF-IDF fallback) for semantic relevance scoring; the Document layer **shares the same StaticEmbedder vector space with Context** (the embedder is injected into the Document Store at agent startup via `docStore.SetVectorizer(embedder)`), ensuring that relevance scores during Context pruning and semantic retrieval during Document queries operate within the same vector space — TF-IDF serves only as a fallback when the embedder is unavailable; the Graph layer uses SQLite as its persistence substrate with an entities table (nodes) and a relations table (directed edges), supporting BFS traversal recall. Data migration policies govern movement across tiers: low-scoring events sink from Context to Document (vectorized using the same embedder at archival time); cold documents, after a 72-hour no-access threshold, are distilled into triples via `docToTriples` and committed to Graph. The Indexer uses dual retrieval (entity vector similarity search + jieba keyword extraction) to construct Graph query seeds, and the `MarkRecalled` mechanism prevents entities already fetched via tool calls from being re-injected into the system prompt.

**The separation of core domain and application domain** constrains the kernel's responsibilities to LLM orchestration, memory management, and knowledge retrieval — no direct IO operations; all external interaction is mediated through the plugin domain. This separation limits the kernel's complexity to a verifiable scope while granting the plugin domain independent evolution: plugins can be independently developed, independently released, hot-loaded, and do not directly affect the stability of the core domain.

## Message Processing Flow

```

Code: `internal/agent/core/process.go` — `process()` is the main tool loop

### 7 Stage Hooks

| Stage | Trigger | Plugin Capabilities |
|-------|---------|---------------------|
| `on_input` | Message arrives at Agent, zero processing | Blacklist/rate-limit/short-circuit reply |
| `pre_action` | Context ready, before LLM call | Inject external data into context |
| `post_action` | LLM returns text + tool list | Sensitive word filter/forced redirect |
| `before_toolcall` | Before single tool execution | Audit/reject/modify params |
| `after_toolcall` | After single tool execution | Desensitize/sort results |
| `before_output` | Final text ready, before sending | Format adaptation |
| `after_output` | Already sent | Statistics/logging |

Code: `internal/agent/core/stages.go` — `StageHost` orchestration

### Loop Rules

`post_action → [before_toolcall → execute → after_toolcall] → post_action` forms the inner loop.
Exit conditions: LLM has no tool calls / all rejected / exceeded limit.

### Short-Circuit Rules

Setting `ctx.Response` at any stage jumps to `after_output`.


## Three-Layer Memory

### Memory Flow

```
① Context (Working Window)
   RelevanceContext — In-memory events[] + JSON persistence
   Append: Each input, CleanTemplateText → three-branch vector(textForVector)
           agent→Response, user→Input, cold_storage→Input+Response
           Vector layers: unified multimodal space (primary, with fingerprint) → StaticEmbedder word embedding → TF-IDF (fallback)
   Prune:  DenseCosine (compared only within the same fingerprint) → StaticEmbedder CosineSimilarity fallback; keep topK + last 10
       ├── Keep → timeline → chronologically sorted → system prompt
       └── Low score → Document layer archive (original timestamp)
   Save: 5s debounce write to disk

         ↓ Prune archive                       ↑ LLM active recall

② Document (File Memory)
   DocStore — JSON files + dense vectors (unified multimodal space; dense_fp must match the current space fingerprint or the doc is recomputed; fallback: StaticEmbedder / TF-IDF InvertedIndex)
   Write: Prune archive / doc_commit / Graph snapshot (syncGraphToDocs)
   Read:
       ├── Auto-inject: Query(input, top3) → similarity summary under same vector space → [Related Memory Docs] → system prompt (read-only)
       └── LLM active:  doc_query → Consume(read and delete)
                         → context.Append{Timestamp: d.CreatedAt, Source: "cold_storage"} per doc
                         → Docs written to context timeline with original timestamps, deleted from docStore
   Cold: FindColdDocs(72h, ≤2 accesses) → docToTriples → Graph

         ↓ Cold doc distillation               ↑ Auto recall

③ Graph (Graph Database)
   SQLite — entities + relations tables
   Write: memory_commit / cold doc distillation / Pipeline rule distillation / memory_merge
   Read:
       ├── Auto recall: Indexer.BuildContext(input)
       │     → CleanTemplateText → vector entity search + jieba keywords → SQLite LIKE + BFS depth=2
       │     → [Memory Index] → system prompt
       └── LLM active: memory_recall / memory_merge / memory_purge / memory_edit / memory_delete_entity
   Social: person_query / set_trait / relate (wraps GraphDB)

④ Four Independent Heartbeat Loops (separate tickers and config intervals)
   distillLoop  (distillInterval,  default 30m):  Context pruning — Context.Prune → Document
   archiveLoop (archiveInterval, default 60m):  Cold doc archival — docToTriples → GraphDB
   mergeLoop   (mergeInterval,   default 120m): Entity merge detection — similarity → LLM decision
   reviewLoop  (reviewInterval,  default 120m): Relation review — SentenceRef recall → LLM fix

⑤ Pipeline Rule Distiller (every 10min heartbeat)
   distillOnce → regex match personal info:
     我叫X / 我住在X / 我喜欢X / 我X岁 / 我的工作是X
     → triples → GraphDB.Commit
```

### Vectorization: Unified Multimodal Space (primary) → Word Embedding → TF-IDF (fallback)

Vectorization degrades through three layers by availability; **each missing layer reports an explicit
error and never pretends to succeed**:

**① Unified multimodal space (primary path, since v1.2.0)**
Text and images share **one model, one dimension, one fingerprint** (default `chineseclip`: 512d,
Apache-2.0, Chinese-native; `qwen3vl` or an external `http` provider are alternatives).
Providers register through the public `pkg/embedding` SPI — **the kernel hardcodes no model**.
Vectors persist together with their fingerprint (`dense_fp` / `vec_model`); any mismatch with the
current fingerprint triggers recomputation, and only blocks with the **same fingerprint and the same
dimension** participate in fusion (mixing coordinate systems yields a direction resembling neither).

**② Word embedding (text fallback)** — `StaticEmbedder` (`internal/memory/static_embedder.go`):

**Model sources** (aligned 300d)
- Model sources: ConceptNet Numberbatch (77-language aligned) / fastText Chinese / fastText English
- Configured via `core.agent.embedding_model_path` (comma-separated multi-model)
- Path containing `numberbatch` → auto-download ConceptNet; `cc.zh.` → fastText Chinese; `cc.en.` → fastText English
- Falls back to ConceptNet by default if no match
- **Pre-processing**: plugins register per-tool `Cleaner` functions; `textForVector` applies them before `CleanText` final normalization
- **Three-branch vector source**: agent→Response, user→Input, cold_storage→Input+Response
- **TF-IDF fallback**: auto-fallback to bag-of-words TF-IDF if model download fails or not configured

| Location | File | Purpose | Algorithm |
|----------|------|---------|-----------|
| Context Prune | `context.go:155` | Trim low-relevance context events | VectorizeClean → CosineSimilarity(queryVec, evt.Vector) |
| DocStore Query | `document.go:206` | Recall from document memory | StaticEmbedder.Vectorize (primary) / TF-IDF (fallback) → vec.Search |
| Indexer Entity Search | `indexer.go:96+111` | Recall from Graph | vector entity search + jieba keywords → SQLite LIKE + BFS |
| Entity Similarity Detection | `distill.go` | Detect similar entities in Graph | Bigram Jaccard (>0.75 → consolidation) |

### Context Layer

`internal/agent/core/context.go` — `RelevanceContext`
- Maintains recent event list, writes JSON on each Append/Prune to prevent data loss
- Pre-vectorization pipeline: per-tool `Cleaner` functions strip template noise, then `CleanText` for basic whitespace normalization
- Three-branch `textForVector`: agent events → Response, user events → Input, cold_storage → Input+Response
- Pretrained word embedding `StaticEmbedder` → CosineSimilarity, auto-fallback to TF-IDF if unavailable
- Protects last 10 events from eviction; excess candidates are sorted by relevance and archived to document memory
- Archived events retain original timestamps; on `doc_query` recall they re-insert into the context timeline at their original position

### Document Layer

`internal/memory/document/document.go` — `Store`
- Consume-on-read mode: deleted after `doc_query` retrieval
- Dual recall: shared StaticEmbedder semantic vector search + jieba keyword extraction (falls back to char-bigram TF-IDF when model is not loaded)

### Graph Layer

`internal/memory/graph.go` — `GraphDB`
- SQLite WAL mode, two tables (driver: mattn/go-sqlite3, CGo)
- `Commit(triples)` — UPSERT entities + INSERT relations
- `Recall(keywords, depth)` — Keyword LIKE search + BFS traversal

### Memory Tools (LLM-callable)

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `memory_recall` | Recall from Graph |
| `memory_commit` | Write triples to Graph |
| `memory_merge` | Merge two entity nodes |
| `memory_purge` | Delete entity node |
| `memory_edit` | Edit existing entity/relation |
| `memory_delete_entity` | Delete entity and all its relations |
| `memory_introspect` | View memory statistics |
| `doc_query` | Search from Document |
| `doc_commit` | Write to Document |

Since v1.1.1 `memory_commit` and `doc_commit` accept `media_digests`, and the kernel appends the
`[<mime> <short digest>] <description>` marker into the sentence/body — **the kernel builds the
marker, the model only supplies the digest**. Requiring the caller to know the format would mean a
single typo silently breaks reference binding with no error anywhere in the chain. `memory_commit`
also gained `sentence_text`: media references hang off a sentence, so with no sentence there is
nowhere to attach them.

### Media Memory (since v1.2.0: first-class memory blocks)

Media is not attached content but a **first-class memory node**: `internal/memory/media/` is a
content-addressed store (CAS), and graph `block` nodes carry its digest plus its own vector, while
structural edges (e.g. `sentence --contains--> block`) express ownership.

| Concern | Approach | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Addressing | sha256 digest; metadata in SQLite, blobs on disk (`blobs/<first2>/<rest>`, two-level fanout) | Identical bytes stored once; metadata must be queryable, blobs must not live in the database |
| Integrity | Every `Get` re-verifies the digest | Silently returning corrupt data on disk damage is far worse than an error |
| Write atomicity | `.tmp` + rename | A half-written file taken as complete content would permanently poison that digest |
| Retrieval | Blocks carry **their own multimodal vector and fingerprint** and are searched directly | No description text is needed as an intermediary |
| Lifecycle | **No separate GC, no refcounts, no keep-set**; deleting the block deletes the content | Media is a memory node, not a cache that needs keeping alive |

**Description-based indexing is gone**: the old implementation embedded a
`[<mime> <short digest>] <description>` marker in the body and treated the description as the
semantic memory (retrieval used it). That path was removed wholesale in v1.2.0: a description is
second-hand model output, and retrieving "someone else's paraphrase of an image" is strictly worse
than retrieving the image's own vector. Images are now retrieved only by their own vector in the
unified space, and no media marker is written into the body.

**Cross-space vector migration**: media rows store their vector together with `vec_model` (the space
fingerprint). At startup `reembedStaleMedia()` recomputes and **writes back** every row whose
`vec_model` is empty (never embedded) or differs from the current space (model/dimension switched).
Modalities outside the space return `ErrModalityUnsupported` — the kernel **never substitutes
another model's vector**.

The media store is **optional throughout**: with `core.memory.media.enabled=false` or no
configuration, the whole chain silently degrades to plain-text behaviour — no errors, no panics.

### Other Memory Layers

- **Social** (`internal/memory/social/social.go`) — Persona traits and relationship network, wraps GraphDB entity types
- **Text Memory** (`internal/memory/text/text.go`) — Raw conversation JSONL logs, rotation strategy
- **Memory Indexer** (`internal/memory/indexer.go`) — Entity vectorization + jieba keyword extraction, auto-inject into system prompt

### Distillation Pipeline

`internal/memory/pipeline/pipeline.go`
- 10-minute tick, 7-day retention
- Rule-based triple extraction (name / location / likes / age / job patterns)
- Writes to GraphDB

### Context Pruning

```
Four independent heartbeat loops (each with configurable interval):
  ├── distillLoop  (distillInterval,  default 30m)
  │   └── distillContext() — Context.Prune → Document
  ├── archiveLoop (archiveInterval, default 60m)
  │   └── archiveColdDocs() — Cold docs → docToTriples → GraphDB
  ├── mergeLoop   (mergeInterval,   default 120m)
  │   └── detectEntityMerge() — Entity similarity detection → LLM decision
  └── reviewLoop  (reviewInterval,  default 120m)
      └── reviewRelations() — Relation review → SentenceRef recall → LLM fix
```

Entity conflict detection heuristic (bigram Jaccard > 0.75), routed through `selfInputCh` internal channel, LLM makes the final merge decision.


## Knowledge Base

`internal/knowledge/knowledge.go`
- File directory `knowledge/<name>/content.md`
- Independent TF-IDF index, separate from memory system
- `knowledge_search` / `knowledge_create` / `knowledge_list`


## Provider & Lua Adapter Layer

```
Agent
  │
  ▼
Provider Interface (Name / Chat / ChatStream)
  │
  ├── OpenAIProvider   — Standard OpenAI API
  ├── OllamaProvider   — Local Ollama
  └── LuaAdaptedProvider (primary)
      ├── Serialize CompletionRequest → JSON
      ├── adapter.transform_request() → API format
      ├── HTTP request + adapter.headers
      ├── adapter.transform_response() → unified format
      └── Deserialize
```

Code: `internal/agent/api/provider.go`

ProviderManager manages multiple sources, fallback in registration order. Lua adapters at `internal/lua/adapters/`, each `.lua` script defines `transform_request` / `transform_response` / `transform_stream_chunk`.

VM built-ins: `json.encode` / `json.decode` / `log` / `http_get` / `http_post`.


## Plugin System

### Four Loading Methods

| Method | Registration Mechanism | Compilation | Usage |
|--------|----------------------|-------------|-------|
| Built-in | `init()` → `RegisterFactory` | `internal/plugins/` compiled into kernel | webui/cli/timer/mcp etc. |
| External subprocess plugin | Handshake + stdio JSON-RPC reverse registration | `hmapdev build` → `plugin.bin` (ordinary Go binary) | qq/browser/files etc. |
| Lua script plugin | Execute `main.lua` to register tools | No compilation, takes effect after restart/reload | luademo etc. |
| SKILL plugin | Parse `SKILL.md` | Markdown definition | Loaded via clawhubadapter |

Built-in plugin registration: `internal/plugins/all.go` blank imports → each plugin `init()` → `Registry.Load()` scans directory to match factory.

External plugin loading (since v1.0.0): `internal/plugin/dynamic_proc.go` → `exec.Command(plugin.bin)`
→ inherit shared-segment fds → handshake (protocol version check) → `plugin.init` → `plugin.start`
(the plugin reverse-registers tools/stages/channels during this window).
**The C ABI channel (`-buildmode=c-shared` + bridge) was removed entirely in v1.0.0**—
the old `plugin.Open` path-cache workarounds (SHA256 temp-path copies) retired with it.

Lua script plugin loading: `internal/plugin/` → the gopher-lua interpreter executes `main.lua` (at load time `sdk.register_*` only buffers handlers), then `Start()` swaps in the real SDK implementation and registers them in batch. The script is read only once at load time; runtime execution happens via callbacks.

### Built-in vs External Plugins

| Dimension | Built-in Plugin | External Plugin |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Registration | `init()` calls `plugin.RegisterFactory(name, factory)` | Implements `NewPluginFactory(name, config) (sdk.Plugin, error)` entry function |
| Compilation | Compiled into `homed` binary, no separate build | Compiled via `hmapdev build` to `plugin.bin` (ordinary Go binary, zero cgo); the kernel spawns it as a subprocess |
| Distribution | Bundled with kernel, not independently installable | `.hmap` package (ZIP archive), installed via WebUI or pluginmgr API |
| Metadata | `plugin.RegisterPluginMeta()` for display name | `plugin.json` manifest file (name, version, entry, platforms, capabilities, etc.) |
| Plugin directory | No separate directory, compiled into binary | `plugins/<name>/` independent directory with `plugin.json` + `plugin.bin` |
| SDK permissions | Full PluginSDK (SocialAPI read/write, Publish events) | Narrowed `procCore` surface + manifest capabilities declaration + RPC boundary rejection |
| Lifecycle | Starts/stops with kernel, no individual hot-reload | Independent process; true hot-reload by swapping `plugin.bin` (ReloadOne) plus enable/disable |
| Crash recovery | No independent recovery | Process-level isolation: a crash cannot take down the kernel; the kernel detaches its registrations then restarts it with backoff (`SetAutoRestart(false)` opts out) |

Common ground:
- Built-in `RegisterFactory` and external `NewPluginFactory` share the same `NativeFactory` type signature
- `Registry.Load()` handles both uniformly: checks the factory table first (built-in), otherwise dispatches by the manifest `entry` to the proc / lua / skill channel
- Both use the same `Plugin` interface and public SDK API; tool registration, stage hooks, and output channel APIs are identical
- Both share the same tool registry (`StageHost`); LLM invocations treat them identically

### The Three Communication Planes of Subprocess Plugins (v1.0.0)

| Plane | Mechanism | Why this choice |
|---|---|---|
| Control | stdio JSON-RPC (NDJSON frames), 55 `core.*` methods | The process boundary *is* the ABI boundary—no need to maintain three platform-specific dynamic-library loaders |
| Data | Shared memory segment, **one segment shared by all subprocesses** | One segment per plugin would degrade "kernel ctx → segment → plugin mutates → read back" into the copy model under concurrency, reproducing lost updates exactly |
| Notification | Event ring + platform notify (Linux eventfd / macOS pipe / Windows Event) | The kernel must never block on a consumer: streaming output publishes per token, so any wait shows up as stutter |

**Subprocess lifecycle management**:
- One dedicated `waitLoop` per subprocess (the sole `cmd.Wait()` call site)—it does not rely on
  stdout EOF, because grandchild processes forked by a plugin (browser spawning chromium,
  editdoc spawning python) inherit the same stdout, so EOF never arrives after the plugin itself dies
- Central ledger `proc.Supervisor`: registered on successful handshake, unregistered on exit;
  `Host.Close()` runs StopAll before tearing down the segment (reversing that order leaves plugins
  holding a mapping that has been unmapped—SIGBUS on their next access)
- Crash self-healing: detach registrations (tools + stage handlers + IO channels) → remove from
  the registry → restart with backoff
- Linux `Pdeathsig` is the last-resort guard so subprocesses do not linger as orphans when homed is SIGKILLed

### PluginSDK Four Channels

```
Plugin ──→ Kernel

RegisterTool(name, fn)   ──→  buildToolDefs() / executeToolCall()
RegisterStage(stage, fn, scope...)  ──→  runStage() called at corresponding phase (scope: global / own-tools-only)
Subscribe(event, fn)      ──→  Publish() notify all subscribers
RegisterOutputChannel(name, caps, desc, handler) ──→ output_send__{name} tool generation
```

`internal/sdk/` bridges external SDK interface to kernel, defines complete PluginSDK:

```go
sdk.RegisterTool(name, def, handler)
sdk.RegisterStage(stage, handler, scope...)
sdk.Publish(event)
sdk.InjectInput(source, channel, payload)
sdk.InjectInterrupt(source, channel, payload)
sdk.Memory().Recall/Commit
sdk.Knowledge().Search/Create
sdk.Settings().Get/Set/List
sdk.RegisterOutputChannel("qq", sdk.CapText|sdk.CapAudio|sdk.CapImage, "QQ channel, see output_send__qq_help for details", handler)

// v1.1.1 media APIs (all additive, no signature changes)
sdk.DocMemory().InsertWithMedia(doc, attachments)   // attachments with Data land in CAS; Digest-only ones reference existing content
sdk.InjectInputMedia(source, channel, text, blocks) // media reaches the model in *this* turn
sdk.InjectInputMediaSync(...)                       // same, and waits for the reply
sdk.InjectInterruptMedia(...)                       // media-bearing interrupt, can preempt current processing
```

How media injection differs from `SetToolBlocks`: the latter is only callable inside a tool handler
and its media reaches the model with the **next** tool message; these three let a plugin
**initiate a turn that carries media** — it goes out with this turn's message and is automatically
stored in CAS with a memory reference attached. `Triple` and `Doc` gained `MediaDigests` /
`Attachments` correspondingly.

`internal/sdk/` is the bridge implementation for this layer and is not subject to the public
interface freeze (see `docs/git-branching.md` §6).

### Plugin Interface

```go
type Plugin interface {
    Name() string
    Start(sdk *PluginSDK) error
    Stop() error
}
```


## Output Channel System

Each output channel generates two tools:

| Tool | Type | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `output_send__{name}` | function | Accepts `payload` (content), `meta` (JSON routing metadata), `type` (enum) — routed to plugin handler |
| `output_send__{name}_help` | function | Returns the channel's meta format and type enum documentation |

Capability flags:

| Flag | Value | Meaning |
|------|-------|---------|
| CapText | 1 | Plain text |
| CapFile | 2 | File |
| CapImage | 4 | Image |
| CapAudio | 8 | Audio |
| CapStructured | 16 | Structured data |

System prompt injection: output gate rules, multi-call support, long message splitting.
Child agent permission: `output_send__` prefix tools are allowed.


## EventAgentLLMChain Event

- Event type `agent_llm_chain` emitted after each LLM turn
- Contains the full LLM response (text + tool calls + reasoning)
- WebUI subscribes to this event via SSE for real-time display
- Plugins can subscribe via EventSubscriber (read-only for external plugins)


## Restricted External Plugin API

Layered architecture: internal plugins get full PluginSDK, external plugins get restricted SDK.

| API | Internal Plugin | External Plugin |
|-----|-----------------|-----------------|
| SocialAPI | Full read/write | Read-only (GetPerson / GetTrait / GetRelations / GetNetwork / ListPersons) |
| EventSubscriber | Subscribe + Publish | Subscribe-only (no Publish capability) |

Extended fields:
- Triple extensions: Confidence, SubjectType, ObjectType
- Relation extension: Confidence


## Input Scheduler & Interrupt Mechanism

Inputs do not go straight to the LLM — they first enter the **input scheduler**
(`internal/agent/core/scheduler.go`). Full design:
[`docs/zh/input-scheduler-design.md`](../../../docs/zh/input-scheduler-design.md).

### Two task classes

| Class | Level | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `TaskQueued` | none (always 0) | Pending work. Any interrupt (≥ L1) preempts it |
| `TaskInterrupt` | L1–L4 | "How urgent is this", declared by the source via `InjectOptions.Priority` |

### Four interrupt levels

| Level | Meaning | Typical source |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| L1 Background | Fully deferrable | QQ/WeChat messages, bulk notifications |
| L2 Message | General notice | Plugin hints that should be seen soon but aren't urgent |
| L3 Interactive | Needs timely handling | Timer expiry, terminal output, resident-agent reports |
| L4 Critical | **Kernel-exclusive** | panic, kernel events, kernel-level plugin stop button |

When no level is declared it defaults to **L1** — "explicit is a privilege", so a new
plugin never gets preemption rights by accident. L4 declared by an external plugin is
**clamped to L3** (`clampPluginLevel`).

### Preemption and suspension

- **Same level never preempts same level** (`canPreempt` requires strictly greater) —
  this is why messages normally wait for the running task to finish.
- A preempted task is pushed onto the **interrupt stack** (LIFO) with its frame saved,
  and resumed later; the stack is never re-sorted by priority.
- **Starvation guard**: preemption count raises the effective level
  (`effectiveLevel = Level + min(PreemptCount, 2)`, capped at L4).
- **Preemption cooldown**: a just-preempted task cannot be preempted again for
  `preemptCooldown` (2s), so a high-priority stream cannot interrupt the same task forever.
- The interrupt stack depth is structurally bounded (chain = queued ← L1 ← L2 ← L3 ← L4).

### Stop (user presses stop / `/stop`)

Stop is not an empty interrupt. It does two things: ① cancel the current LLM inference;
② short-circuit the x messages **already queued at the moment of stop** during their
pre-action phase (`cancelBudget` snapshot), instead of running them as new input.
Inputs arriving **after** the stop are unaffected.

`PendingInputs()` must include the segment still sitting in `io.inputCh` (not yet moved
into the queue by `pumpInbox`) — during a stop the scheduler is usually busy running a
task, and counting only `sched.queue` yields 0.

### Resident sub-agents and timely feedback

Design: [`docs/zh/resident-subagent-design.md`](../../../docs/zh/resident-subagent-design.md).

- A **resident** is an independent lightweight-kernel agent: its own scheduler, its own
  temp graph memory, sharing the channel registry.
- Parent→child control plane: `resident_agents`
  (list / create / send / inspect / compress / reclaim / destroy).
- **Backlog feedback**: when the main agent is busy for a long time (default > 5m,
  configurable), the kernel hands queued inputs to a temporary **triage assistant**
  (`offload_*` config): simple ones are handled directly, ones needing the main agent
  get an immediate "busy, please wait". Users no longer wait 10+ minutes in silence.
- The triage assistant gets **no inputch** (it receives no plugin user input) and
  **all output channels** (results must reach the original channel).
- On reclaim/destroy, its **residual tasks are decided explicitly by the parent**:
  `residual=keep` (returned to the parent queue, default) or `drop` (explicitly
  discarded with a per-item log entry).

### Legacy three-path view (still present, now a layer beneath the scheduler)

```
interceptLoop (goroutine)
  ├── InputInterruptChan() ← Timer/message notifications
  ├── (a) cancelLLM() → Cancel Provider HTTP request
  ├── (b) interceptCh → process() pre-loop read [interrupt message]
  └── (c) InjectInput() → Trigger new processing when idle
```

Code: `internal/agent/core/scheduler.go` (scheduler), `eventloop.go` (intercept loop).

## Context Budget

`internal/agent/core/tokenbudget.go` — `ComputeTokenBudget`:

```
maxCtx        = provider.MaxContextTokens()      // declared window (per-source context_window wins)
targetUsage   = min(maxCtx × 0.8, 600000)        // working band, capped at 600K
  ├── memory recall budget = (targetUsage - fixed) / 3
  └── context events budget = remaining 2/3
```

★ **Window ≠ working band**: a source's real window may reach 1M, but near-full windows
lose attention and cost/latency rise linearly, so `maxTargetTokens=600000` caps the
working band separately. If the model name (e.g. `AUTO`) yields no window,
`ModelContextWindow` **logs a warning** and falls back conservatively; operators should
declare `core.llm.sources.<name>.context_window` explicitly.

**Budgets are ceilings, not fill targets**: memory is recall-ranked (it stops when nothing
is relevant) and the timeline is taken newest-first within budget. Measured: with a 400K
budget, actual injection was still a few hundred characters.


## Configuration System

`internal/config/registry.go` — ConfigRegistry

- SQLite storage, `config` table + `config_<plugin>` independent tables
- Namespaces: `core.*` / `plugin.<name>.*`
- `RegisterDefault` inserts ~80 default keys (seeds for 8 LLM sources)
- WebUI settings page `/api/v1/settings` for read/write
